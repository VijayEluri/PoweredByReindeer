This project serves as a starting point to create Vaadin applications on
Google's App Engine.

It uses Maven to create portable and reproducable builds. The Maven file also
includes setup for an Eclipse workspace. If you don't use Eclipse, you might
want to remove those sections.

To get started, just run:
> mvn clean

And if you want to create the Eclipse project:
> mvn eclipse:eclipse
